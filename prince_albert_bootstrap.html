				<h2>Plan your visit</h2>
			  
				<p>Prince Albert National Park is in central Saskatchewan, 232 kilometres north of Saskatoon, along Highway 2 (approximately 2.5 hours by car). The City of Prince Albert is 91 km south of the park (approximately one hour by car). Most visitors choose to use the small lakeside town of Waskesiu, located within the park, as a base for exploration. A full range of accommodation, from hotels to cabins and campsites is available in town. From Waskesiu, roads and trails lead to lakes and backcountry terrain.</p>

		    <h2>Biology</h2>
            <p>Prince Albert National Park represents the southern boreal forest region of Canada. It is a rolling, mostly forested landscape that takes in the drainage divide between the North Saskatchewan and Churchill Rivers. Most of the park is dominated by coniferous forests, with the cover of jack pine and white spruce becoming more prevalent the farther north one looks. The park is noted for its numerous lakes including three very large lakes - Waskesiu, Kingsmere and Crean. </p>

            <p>Some of the many animals are elk, moose, red foxes, beavers, white-tailed deer, badgers, bison, river otters, red squirrels, black bears, coyotes, and timber wolves.

There are 21 species of fish recorded in the park, including Iowa darter, yellow perch, brook stickleback, spottail shiner, cisco, northern pike (locally called "jack fish"), walleye (locally called "pickeral"), and lake trout.</p>
